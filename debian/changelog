html2text (1.3.2a-7) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/patches:
    - 500-utf8-support.patch: corrected calculating length of utf8 string
      containing 3 or 4 bytes by character (important for Japanese, for
      example). So, since now we claim support for all UTF-8 characters.
      (Closes: #178684)
    - 510-utf8-implies-nobs.patch: inserting backspaces by default is
      completely breaks the output when utf8 mode is used. Thus '-utf8' option
      now implies enabling '-nobs' option. (Closes: #495448)
  * debian/html2text.1:
    - Updated last modified date.
    - Mentioned that '-utf8' now implies '-nobs'.
  * debian/rules:
    - Now using dpkg-buildpackage-provided CFLAGS variable. This adds '-Wall'
      to compilation flags.
